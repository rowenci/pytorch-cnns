# pytorch-cnns

In this code base. You can get convolutional neural network models.

There are LeNet, AlexNet, NiN, VGG, GoogLeNet, DenseNet and ResNet implemented by PyTorch.

The training and testing set are all from FashionMNIST in torchvision.

Trainging and testing code are also prepared.

You can see the loss and accuracy in trainging of a model through the TensorBoard.
